      "Social capital is the combination of networks, engagement, and willingness to invest in community, thus allowing residents to work together for the community’s mutual benefit.  Though difficult to measure directly, secondary data can serve as a proxy and provide some insights. Of the four measures analyzed in the WIndicator – Social Capital in Wisconsin [1], the focus for this programming is the number of associations (networks are built through interaction) and the number of non-profits (a signal of engaged, mission-driven community members) within our communities.Associations provide members of the community the opportunity to interact with one another, building and strengthening both networks and, perhaps, trust within the county. In addition, the creation of these associations reflects the willingness and ability of people within the community to invest in themselves and the wider community. Like that of associations, non-profits are also opportunities to network and invest in a community.An important part of promoting a healthy neighborhood and local economy is finding out what neighborhood associations are functioning in your community. Collectively, the activities of these organizations represent an asset [2].Pinpointing available local individual and associational assets, connecting them with one another in ways that multiply their power and effectiveness, and engaging local institutions that are not yet available for local development purposes is referred to as asset-based community development.
