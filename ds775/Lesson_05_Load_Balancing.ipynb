    "# Load Balancing Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we're going to show how you could use various approaches to solve a load balancing problem. Load balancing is when you want to divide a workload as evenly as possible among a set of resources. If we're talking execution times on servers, we can describe it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "given a list of $n$ execution times, divide them to be executed on $k$ processors so that the total execution time on each processor is as close to the same as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a quick example to illustrate this. Say we had 4 jobs that needed to execute and they had the following times: [2,2,4,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had 2 servers to divide them between, we could have one server do [2,2] and one server do [2,4] or we could have each server do [2,4]. (We could also have one server doing [2,2,4] and one doing [4], but we'll keep it simple for this example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective function is total squared deviation of times from balanced times. What does that mean? Well, balanced times is when the total execution time on each server is the same as every other server. But, if our loads are out of balance, some servers will be doing much more work. We want to know the difference between what each server would run if things were in balance and what they are actually running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $s$ is the sum of all execution times, and $k$ is the number of servers, determing our objective function by hand would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/startloadbalancing.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were perfectly load balanced, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/endloadbalancing.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into working out this same problem in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll set our times as a numpy array and we'll create an objective function that does all our calculations for us. In order for the objective function to work, we need to know how to assign each execution time. We'll create another numpy array that has the number of the server to assign to, and we'll use index filtering to fetch each \"set\" of processing times. (We'll walk you through what we're talking about in the comments below.)"
