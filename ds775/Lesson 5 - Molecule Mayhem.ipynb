More likely, our randomly generated molecules will not be allowed solutions. (There are rules about which atoms can bond together and in what order.) Our goal will be to make as many allowed molecules as possible, by making small changes to the existing candidate in each iteration. (Don't worry. We'll let you know what the allowed molecules look like.) \n",

    "## Simulated Annealing - simanneal package\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice things about doing our own home-grown simulated annealing is that we were able to write functions to encapsulate our code. When we use the simanneal package, we'll have to use special functions that are part of the simmanneal class, and put our code there. That's okay! We'll walk you through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One function that doesn't need to change is our setupMolecule() function. That will stay exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within our perturbMolecules function is going to get recreated inside the move() function in simanneal. The move() function is the package's version of whatever it is you need to do to change the current state. If we were literally walking in the mountains trying to find the highest peak, the move() function would involve us taking a step. In the traveling salesman problem, it involved us swapping 2 cities in our route. For the molecules problem, it involves are (somewhat complex) perturbation - with the 2 possible options for how we do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within our assessMolecules function will get recreated inside the energy() function in simanneal. In simanneal, the energy function is whatever you need to do to return the NEW value of the PERTURBED state. If I were walking in the mountains and I had an altimeter on, it would be the altimeter reading after I took a step. (Did I go \"up\" the mountain?) In the traveling salesman problem, it's the new total distance of the route. (Did we make it shorter?) In our molecules problem, it's the new number of molecules that are viable molecues. (Did we find another viable molecule?)\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "* perturbMolecules -> move()\n",
    "* assessMolecules -> energy()\n",
    "\n",
    "The simanneal package is going to take care of all of the comparing of current value to new value for us. That's the advantage. If the current value is **less than** the existing value, simanneal will replace the current state with the new state. That's right - simanneal ALWAYS minimizes. This means that if your problem is to maximize something (in our molecule problem we're maximizing the total number of molecules that are viable), you'll need to negate your energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk a little bit about what the \"state\" is, too. The state can be any kind of variable, and it holds the current data. This data isn't the VALUE we're comparing. That's in the energy. It's the actual data that we're working with. In our case, we have 2 bits of data we are working with in each iteration - the atoms and the molecules. There's two ways to handle multiple variables. You've already seen one method (passing in the distance_matrix). But, since both our atoms and our molecules can change in each go-round, we want simanneal to handle that for us. We don't want to have to test to see if the atoms should be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we let simanneal handle it for us? Easy, we make a dictionary that includes both our molecules and atoms, and we use that as our state.\n",
